# Denton Kiosk Design Plan

## About

We (TechMill Denton) are building a web application that aggregates useful information to Denton residents and newcomers visiting our community. This app will initially be live on an iPad in a moderate-traffic public space while we perform beta testing with users, and eventually  housed permanently in a large, rigid enclosure right on the square.

Our community is extremely active and oftentimes there are many events happening concurrently, but thereâ€™s not a single resource which aggregates all of that data.

## Resources
* Real-time DCTA information
	* Train and bus stops
	* Current location
	* Prices/plans

* Environmental data
	* Weather
	* Air quality

* Community events (Calendar)
	* Community market
	* Upcoming concerts and meet-ups
	* Aggregate from social media

* Facts
	* Recycling
	* Green energy availability
	* Cost of living, density, crime statistics
	* Historical factoids

* Local news
	* Denton record-chronicle

## Data collection
Another key purpose of this application is its data collection capabilities.
