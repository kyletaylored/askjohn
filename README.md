# Ask Denton
A freestanding kiosk for Downtown Denton.

## History
Back in 2014, we ran a small but effective project called Listen Denton that captured feedback from Denton citizens regarding issues they see in the city, and what they think a solution would be. This gave us great insight into an active citizen's perspective of how they see the city, but also an open format for brainstorming solutions.

We ended up aggregating these issues and solutions down into 6 projects, each being presented to city council with an associated technology solution. This was the first step into our path towards becoming a WhatWorksCity by Bloomberg Philanthropies.

## Now
With our work in open data and open source, our group is striving towards building an interactive kiosk hosted in downtown Denton that can serve not only as a source of information, but also as a public way of collecting feedback from citizens. We'll populate the interface with helpful points around town, tourist markers, and other items - in addition to a capability of collecting user feedback.
